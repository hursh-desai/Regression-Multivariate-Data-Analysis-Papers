# Regression-Multivariate-Data-Analysis-Papers
Research papers through which I learned how to do in depth regression analysis in R. Included in these papers in addition to the regression are the arguably more important analysis of the regression diagnostics such as autocorrelation, variance, covariance, and nonconstant variance for the purpose of model selection. 

Research Paper 2 - Basic Regression   
Research Paper 3 - Multiple Regression
